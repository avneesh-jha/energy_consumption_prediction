To determine which model is the best, we can compare the evaluation metrics: MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R². Here's a breakdown of each metric and how it relates to model performance:

1. Mean Absolute Error (MAE):
MAE measures the average magnitude of the errors in the predictions, without considering their direction (whether the prediction is above or below the actual value).
A lower MAE indicates better performance.
Linear Regression: 0.0265
XGBoost: 0.0169
Interpretation: The XGBoost model has a lower MAE, which suggests that it is making predictions that are, on average, closer to the actual values compared to Linear Regression.

2. Mean Squared Error (MSE):
MSE measures the average of the squared differences between the actual and predicted values. It penalizes larger errors more heavily due to the squaring of differences.
A lower MSE is preferred, as it indicates that the model's predictions are closer to the true values.
Linear Regression: 0.00175
XGBoost: 0.00087
Interpretation: XGBoost again performs better, with a lower MSE, indicating fewer large errors in its predictions compared to Linear Regression.

3. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):
RMSE is the square root of MSE. It gives the error in the same units as the original data, which makes it more interpretable than MSE.
A lower RMSE is preferred.
Linear Regression: 0.0418
XGBoost: 0.0295
Interpretation: XGBoost has a lower RMSE, indicating that its predictions are, on average, closer to the true values in terms of the magnitude of errors.

4. R² (Coefficient of Determination):
R² explains how well the model fits the data. It represents the proportion of the variance in the target variable that is explained by the model. An R² value closer to 1 indicates a better fit.
A higher R² indicates better performance.
Linear Regression: 0.9987
XGBoost: 0.9994
Interpretation: Both models have very high R² values, indicating excellent fit. However, XGBoost has a slightly higher R², which suggests that it explains a bit more of the variance in the target variable.

Summary Comparison:
MAE: XGBoost (better)
MSE: XGBoost (better)
RMSE: XGBoost (better)
R²: XGBoost (better)
Conclusion:
Although both models are performing very well, the XGBoost model is marginally better than Linear Regression across all evaluation metrics:

XGBoost has lower error values (MAE, MSE, RMSE).
It also has a slightly higher R², indicating a slightly better fit to the data.
Thus, XGBoost would be the better model for predicting energy consumption in this case. However, the difference in performance is quite small, so either model could be suitable depending on the use case, but XGBoost is slightly superior here.
